    "The name is an amalgam of *torch* (from  [PyTorch][1]) and *quad* (from the term *numerical quadrature*). According to [Wikipedia][2], some authors refer to numerical integration over more than one dimension as *cubature*; others take *quadrature* to include higher-dimensional integration as well. As you might have guessed, the authors of this package belong to the latter group:  \n",

A solution is to take a shortcut, i.e. by evaluating the integrand at equally or randomly spaced points. The curse of dimensionality still applies, but at much larger *n*.\n",
